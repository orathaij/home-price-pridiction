The study was divided into two major parts: data preprocessing and machine learning modeling. 
In data preprocessing, the characteristics of the data were studied, including missing data, data distribution, and their correlations. 
In term of machine learning modeling, this study presented models derived from three machine learning algorithms: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, and XGBoost Regression.
